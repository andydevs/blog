Primer is an independent science fiction film that released in 2004, written and directed by former engineer Shane Carruth. The story is about two engineers, Abe and Aaron, who accidentally invent a time traveling device, and use it irresponsably leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. The film is known for its complicated storyline that challenges it's audience by not dumbing down it's explanations. 

I recently watched the movie Primer for the 4th time just recently and I think I mostly got it at this point. It got me thinking, though. Time travel narratives are like the macaroons of storytelling. You really have to know what your doing, otherwise your story will just come out as a soggy mush of plot inconsistencies ([this video by YourMovieSucksDOTorg](https://youtu.be/3a0Oi4gFIro) tears down the inconsistencies in Looper, another time travel movie I love). When it's done right, though, it makes for a mind-boggling masterpiece.

In this post, I'm gonna try my best to explain the plot of Primer, but I'll also establish some general rules and guidelines for others who want to write their own time travel movies that make sense. There will be spoilers, so if you haven't seen Primer yet, _go see it!_ (It's on Netflix and I highly reccomend it) Then come back to this explanation of the plot.

Ok. Here we go.

## How Time Travel Works

Every time travel movie has an explanation for how the time travel works. Back to the Future (one of my favorite movies of all time), explains that the time machine (an old DeLorean) must travel at 88 miles an hour for the flux capacitor to activate allowing travel to whatever destination was inputted onto the dashboard. Now, along with the scientific explanation, there is also the logistics of how time travel works, like "How far can you travel?", "Can you go to the future or the past or both?, "How often can you do it?", etc.. This is what creates the plot of the story. Back to the Future keeps it simple and says that you can travel as often as you like (for all we know), so long as you have plutonium (or garbage), and can get to 88 miles per hour.

Primer's time travel is a bit more advanced.

### The "Science"

Originally the machine was meant to reduce the mass of whatever is inside. Abe and Aaron test this device on a toy Weeble, but the first time they try the device, the power levels become to large and they blow a fuse, abruptly stopping the experiment.

After experimenting and modifying the machine a little (or a lot, as referenced by Abe's "look's like a dog digested it" remark), Aaron discovers something peculiar about the machine. He shows Abe that the machine is actually taking more power than is being supplied to it (seemingly grabbing energy out of thin air). He actually disconnects the machine from the two car batteries powering it, and, to Abe's surprise, it keeps running, apparently under no power. It slows down eventually, but the implications are staggering.

At first they think it's a free energy device. But Abe does more experimenting on his own and realizes something about the energy: _whatever goes into the box seems to experience more time than whatever's outside_. Abe explains this to Aaron by showing him a weeble that he's been using to test the machine, which accumulates a protein film that he would have to wash off every five or so days. Abe explains that this protein, made by a fungus that pretty much exists everywhere, would theoretically take up to 5 years to accumulate the amount if not in the proper conditions (conditions that are certainly not in the device). Abe and Aaron take it to the next level and put their watches inside the machine, where they discover even more peculiar things.

### "A" ends and "B" ends

Since we're dealing with time travel, we have to consider points in time. Let's say Aaron turns on the machine and puts his watch in, then powers down the machine and takes the watch out after a minute. We'll call the beginning of the experiment the "A" end and the end of the experiment (after 1 minute), the "B" end. Abe explains that the watch is in a suspended space-time state, where each end is closed and the watch, rather than travel continuously from the "A" end to the "B" end, bounces back and fourth between the two points in space-time before eventually exiting out at the "B" end on it's own. If the watch starts at the "A" end, it can make any number of round trips between the two ends, but it has to make one extra 1-minute trip to the "B" end before exiting. The total amount of 1-miniute trips the watch has to make before exiting the "B" end will therefore always be 2 times any number of round trips (each being 2-minutes) plus 1 extra trip back to the "B" end, which means that the elapsed time on the watch will always be odd (as Abe predicts before Aaron finishes reading his watch). If the watch is placed in the "B" end of the machine, before it fully powers down, the watch won't have to make an extra 1-minute trip to the "B" end, since it already started at the "B" end, so the time elapsed will be even.

In the scene right afterwards, where Aaron is playing basketball, Abe explains that the watch (or Weeble) will inevitably exit at the "B" end (because of probabilities). But if a smarter device would be placed in the box at the "B" end, it could catch the window of opportunity at the "A" end and exit there, essentially traveling back in time. This all culminates to Aaron realizing that Abe wants to build a human-size time machine.

And, in fact, he already has.

### The Logistics

The time machine will be referred to as the "box", from now on, since that's how the movie describes it (and it's shorter). There are four important rules to time travel in Primer.

1. The box only allows you to travel back in time
2. The box has to be turned on at the time you want to travel back to (the "A" end)
3. The box has to be turned off at the time you're starting from (the "B" end)
4. The time required to travel from the "B" end to the "A" end is the same as the elapsed time between the "A" end and "B" end

An asterisk on the third rule, once the box is "turned off", it takes time to power down, and then whatever's inside begins it's journey back to the "A", so you would have to enter the box _before_ it shuts off completely in order to fully catch the reverse journey.

So if Abe wants to travel to 9:00 AM on Monday, he has to turn on the box at 9:00 AM on Monday. Then, at say 6:00 PM, when he wants to travel back, he turns off the box, and gets in just before it shuts off completely, travels back to 9:00 AM (spending 8 hours in the box).
