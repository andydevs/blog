Ever heard H.P. Lovecraft? I've only just delved into the Cthulhu Mythos. It's the kind of horror that I can take seriously (I like mind-bending horror more than the jumpscar-ey kind). The idea of how insignificant we actually are is unsettling to say the least, existential-crisis-level terrifying at the most.

I will say this, though: H. P. Lovecraft died in 1937, seven years before the first successful detonation of a nuclear bomb.

So maybe, just maybe, he could've underestimated our potential to dominate and rule the universe...

Nonetheless, many of us do take the supposed significance of humanity for granted. Even if we know of that we don't know everything, we still infer that whatever we learn or invent will always be for our benefit.

For the most part, that has been true. Our inventions have made us _so_ powerful, in fact, that we affect the climate and biosphere of the planet earth itself (mostly negatively and unintentionally, but we can still do it). We've built airplanes that can take us halfway around the world in less than a day. We've build rockets that landed us on the moon. And our bio-technology advancements have doubled (if not tripled) our average lifespans. The trend has been clear: technology empowers humans. It makes _us_ stronger, smarter, faster, etc..

But now we get to Artificial Intelligence.

AI has seen a popularity boom over this past decade. Facebook has programs that can detect faces in images and even identify the person that the face belongs to.  You got advanced speech recognition software like Siri and Cortana, now commonplace in everyday laptops and phones. Cars can drive themselves on roads now, changing lanes, navigating city blocks, and even parallel parking.

Then you got that wierd Google Deep Dream thing that's the stuff of nightmares (I don't care how advanced and bleeding-edge it is. It's freaking weird and I don't want to see it).

But hear me out for a second: Does _this_ really have to be the direction we're going to take?

Yes I know I'm gonna sound like some hippie getting ready to take a hike into the forest and tie himself to a tree until he eventually gets eaten alive by a family of koala bears, but I'm not. I'm all for technological progress. [I even built a neural network myself](https://www.github.com/andydevs/neurl). And yes, most of our AI is dumber than a cockroach (weak AI, as they call it). What do I have to worry about?

Think about it for a second. I used to believe that I would have to go back to 1985 to wow people with my impressive computer technologadgets (after correcting people on the actual pronounciation of _giga_-watts). I realize now that I don't have to go that far. I could go back just _ten years_. I could confront my own dang self from the past and tell him that, in 2017, we have programs that can find your _face_ in a picture. We made a computer who beat not just any human, but the two best Jeapordy players _on the planet_ at their own game.

It took millions of years for animals to get that smart. We built the AI in just ten years. It's only a matter of time before we invent an AI that's basically human (a strong AI). In fact, many estimates predict one within a decade or two (in my lifetime).

And that's actually scary...

Because, for the first time, we're building something that will _not_ make us powerful or smart. It could actually make us obselete...

The way I see it, there are three scenarios that could play out:
1. The Super-AI destroys us all
2. The Super-AI spares us but instead locks us in a virtual world so it doesn't have to deal with us
3. The Super-AI allows us to live in the real world, but we now live in the shadow of a much greater, more powerful being that undermines any significance in our existence

Again, I'm not some conservative nut who hates technology. I'm just saying that there are other revolutions that can be made.

Space-travel for example. Think of the economic boom you could create by allowing companies to buy land on other planets. Think of how much more awesome life would be if we could live in other planets. Just imagine a convincing every one of your friends to visit you on Trappist-1-3 because "the weather here is GOOOA-GEOUS".

Isn't that so much cooler?

Oh, come on, Andy! "Space Travel"? That's science fiction stuff! Lets instead build an ultra machine that will destroy our very existence and sense of importance. Now _that's_ realistic!

Maybe I'm reading to deep into it.
