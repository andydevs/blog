Welp, it's that time of the year! The time when we are obsessed with the spooks and scary stuff. That time where everyone has a halloween themed episode/post/thing. Some may have several, depending on how devoted they are to the fall festival of fear. What do I got? Only the king of horror games (currently): Five Nights at Freddy's.

It's a program, so it counts.

Five Nights at Freddy's (or FNaF) is a marvel of video game storytelling. This series has been talked about, disected, taken apart, and analyzed all over the board, and each new installation adds several (_several_) layers to the overarching storyline. The techniques of storytelling used in this game is something I want to elaborate on because I want to see more people doing these, namely one common storytelling technique.

## The Secret Fiction

Traditionally, a story is a contained sequence of events presented in a linear, predictable, understandable matter. A story may have a sequel, another installment of the same work which develops the fiction a little more. A story may also have a prequel, which presents a sequence of events that occur before another story you've already seen. However, these stories will always present the information you need to know (sometimes too much information **cough**_Last Airbender_**cough**), and progress in a linear, predictable fashion. This is the basis of most fictional works that we study and know of.

Five Nights at Freddy's takes this basis and shoves it straight into an empty anamatronic shell.

What Five Nights at Freddy's does instead is tell a second narrative on top of the one presented to you, not directly, not linearly, but sporadically and through hidden, disconnected clues spread throguhout the installments. These need to be actively sought out, disected by loyal fans (and [avid game theorists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOl4b517qn8jl4Lw8H8cDrDkGwf1FtC7I)), and even sometimes coupled with real world facts to make sense of (like using minimum wage calculations and the payment on the check at the end of each game to determine the year that that game takes place in).

This is the true appeal of this game. It doesn't have much in terms of gameplay. If you look at any playthrough of the game, you notice the reactions to the jumpscares quickly fading from absolute horror to just frustration. But the story and the mystery behind every single little detail in and outside the game. The clues extend beyond the game and into promo images and the source code of the website (the _source code_).

## The Fear of Uncertainty

The true genius, though, aside from the way the story is told, is how it fits with the theme of horror. The super story is told mysteriously, through hidden, disturbing clues, about murder and revenge.
