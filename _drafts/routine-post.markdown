Julian Smith is a YouTube content creator that makes short comedic sketches. These are usually well put together with great production quality (more than some big-budget movies), and superb acting talent from Julian and his friends (and the occasional YouTuber guest appearence). Julian has dabbled in a few longer narratives, like the antics of lovable characters such as Jeffery Dallas and Mr. Timn (never forget the "n"), and his funny but brilliant Kidnapped series. But his best works were his funny and random short sketches. However, these are very rarely uploaded, almost with months in between updates. People tended to complain about this a lot, with many of the comments on his videos being "Why don't you upload any videos? I almost forgot I subscribed to your channel!".

I argue that it may actually be better than routine uploads.

For one, having less videos actually _increases_ overall subscriber view counts, if done correctly. Creating too little content may obviously lower your view count, but creating too much content will also reduce the number of views on your channel, [as explained by MatPat]().

On top of the increased attention from the audience from less videos, having the freedom to upload whenever you want lets the creator spend more time/money on each video/blog post to make it.

Finally, having no schedule may seem like a cop-out from the artist, but it is actually more convenient for _both_ the artist and the user.

So why am I telling you this? This whole persuasive essay is just an explanation of why I don't have a routine post schedule for my blog. It is an annoyance for the viewer, it is a burden for the creator, and it is a rigid boulder for both.
