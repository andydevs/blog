Primer is an independent science fiction film that released in 2004. The story is about two engineers, Abe and Aaron, who accidentally invent a time traveling device, and use it irresponsably leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. The film was written and directed by former software engineer Shane Carruth, who also stars as Aaron. The film is known for its complicated storyline that challenges it's audience by not dumbing down it's explanations. I recently watched the movie Primer for the 4th time just recently and I think I mostly got it. I'll do my best to explain the plot in this essay, and there will be spoilers, so if you haven't seen it, _go see it!_ (It's on Netflix and I highly reccomend it) Then come back to this explanation of the plot.

Ok. Here we go.
