Most people count by using their fingers as a reference. You start with (usually) your left index finger, and add more fingers as you count up. This is how we've all learned how to count this way, and we all learned the words for each amount we can count on our fingers:

One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten.

But now you come accross a problem: you only have ten fingers, so how are you going to count beyond ten? Do you start counting your toes? 

No. Most of us know what happens next, but let's take the time to appreciate this system and, later on, it's modern implications. The genius idea, which originated in ancient India (go team!), involves creating a number which means...nothing. The number zero (or 0) indicates that no amount of what you're counting is present. For example: I have 0 peanuts in my pocket right now. That means there are no peanuts.

"Why does that matter?", you may ask. Well, this number is part of a counting system that let's you count to _any_ number imaginable!

We have ten symbols which represent ten different values: 0 (nothing), 1 (one), 2 (two), 3 (three), 4 (four), 5 (five), 6 (six), 7 (seven), 8 (eight), and 9 (nine).

Let's start counting apples (everyone's favorite fruit)! At the start, we have zero apples, which means we have none. Now we'll start adding some apples one at a time:

0 apples,
1 apple,
2 apples,
3 apples,
4 apples,
5 apples,
6 apples,
7 apples,
8 apples,
9 apples...

Now we get to ten, where we do something interesting. Instead of inventing a completely new symbol, we just move these apples aside and say that we have _one_ group of _ten_ apples. We write this by adding a one in front of a zero:

10

What this means is we have 1 group of ten apples and no extra apples.

Let's count some more:

11 apples (ten apples and one apple),
12 apples (ten apples and two apples),
13 apples,
14 apples,
15 apples,
16 apples,
17 apples,
18 apples,
19 apples...

And we now put this new group aside and say we have _two_ groups of ten apples and no extra apples, or:

20

What if we get to _ten_ groups of ten apples? We just add a 1 in front of two zeros:

100

This says that we have one group of ten groups of ten apples, no extra groups of ten apples, and no extra apples. Adding one apple at a time makes 101, 102, 103, and so on. Adding ten apples at a time makes 110, 120, 130, and so on.

We can do this indefinitely, counting to whatever number we can imagine (or be bothered to write down).

Now I know what you're thinking: "I already know this, Andy! It's been burned into my brain when I was in kindergarten!"

Yes, I know that you know, but it gets more interesting, because this is not the only way to count numbers.

First off, this number system (called the decimal system) takes advantage of positioning. The position of a symbol in the (or digit) number indicates it's value in the number. This is where zero is really convenient, because zero helps to fill in empty spaces to let other symbols can be in their proper positions. Without zero, it would be difficult to show the true value of a digit or symbol in a number.

You would have to invent something like the Roman Numeral system. The roman numerals introduce a new symbol for every power of ten, and also halfway between every power of ten:

I is one
V is five
X is ten
L is fifty
C is one hundered
D is five hundered
and M is one thousand

To make things "easier", if you write an I before a V it means 1 before 5, or 4. You can do this with tens, hundereds, and thousands.

If you wanted to represent the number 3457, you would have to write MMM CD L VIII (a lot more writing than the four symbol decimal number).
