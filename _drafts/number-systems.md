Most people count by using their fingers as a reference. You start with (usually) your left index finger, and add more fingers as you count up. We've all learned how to count this way, and we all learned the symbols for each amount we can count on our fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. We also have the additional 0, which represents no value, but plays an important role to how the number system works.

By the time we get to 10, we put the group aside and start at 0 again. This is represented as 10, which stands for 1 group of ten and 0 ones. We can then start counting up again: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. When we get to 20 we put the second group of ten to the side and say we have 2 tens and 0 ones (or 20). We do this for every group of ten until we get to ten groups of ten, at which point we take the whole lot of one hundered and put it aside, representing it as 100 (or one group of ten groups of ten, no groups of ten, and no ones). 

The position of a value in a number represents it's magnitude, with the first position always being 1. If we want to represent something smaller than 1, we place a decimal point after a the first position, after which all positions are tenths. The number 0.123 represents 1 tenth, 2 hundredths, and 3 thousandths. We do this indefinitely to represent any number imaginable.

Now you may be saying "Yes. This is the way we count numbers. Why are you telling me this?" Well, what if I told you that there are other ways to count numbers?

## Roman Numerals

One other number system you've come across is roman numerals, the fancy I's and V's and X's spread around old grandfather clocks and on the Big Ben.

## Base Numbers

Notice how, in decimal, we're grouping every 10'th number. What if we, say, grouped every 8'th number instead? We start counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... and when we get to eight, we move that aside and create a group. 8 becomes 10, which now means 1 group of 8 and no ones. Then we start counting again, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... we group the second 8 and move it over, making 20. Again, this is not twenty anymore, 20 is now 2 groups of 8, or 16.

What if we tried a different number, say 5? We start at 0, and count: 1, 2, 3, 4... we move 5 over and make a group (10 is now 5).

These are called base (or sometimes radix) numbers. For a base-n number, we have a set of n different symbols which represent n different values and create groups of n to represent a value. For example, the base-5 number 231 is actually 66 in decimal.
