Welp, it's that time of the year! The time when we are obsessed with the spooks and scary stuff. That time where everyone has a halloween themed episode/post/thing, or several, depending on how devoted you are to the festival of fear. What do I got? Only the king of horror games (currently), Five Nights at Freddy's.

It's a program, so it counts.

Five Nights is a marvel of video game storytelling. This series has been talked about, disected, taken apart, and analyzed all over the board, and each new installation adds several (_several_) layers to the overarching storyline. The techniques of storytelling used in this game is something I want to elaborate on because I want to see more people doing these, namely one common storytelling technique.

## The Many Layers of Fiction

Traditionally, a fiction is a contained sequence of events which is entered into at the beginning and exited from at the end, presenting the information needed to understand the events that occur in a linear, predictable, understandable matter. A story may have a sequel, another installment of the same work which develops the fiction a little more. A story may also have a prequel, which presents a sequence of events that occur before another story you've already seen. However, these stories will always present the information you need to know (sometimes too much information **cough**_Last Airbender_**cough**), and progress in a linear, predictable fashion. This is the basis of most fictional works that we study and know of.

Five Nights at Freddy's takes this basis and shoves it straight into an empty anamatronic shell.

What Five Nights at Freddy's does instead is tell a second narrative on top of the one presented to you, not directly, not linearly, but sporadically and through hidden, disconnected clues spread throguhout the installments. These need to be actively disected by loyal fans (and [avid game theorists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOl4b517qn8jl4Lw8H8cDrDkGwf1FtC7I)), even sometimes using real world facts (minimum wage calculations and all) to fill in the blanks.
