## How Artificial Intelligence Works

An AI is really an advanced algorithm that optimizes a complex system according to some abstract objective function, some property of the world that tells how good/bad the current state of the world is and how the system needs to change in order for this state to improve.

For narrow intelligence (like what we have now), the objective function is usually measures "correctness" or "fitness", how accurately the machine can predict an "output" value in one set given an "input" value in another set. For example, given a set of images of dogs and cats, the objective function measures how accurately the machine can identify images of dogs as dogs and images of cats as cats.

But it doesn't have to be this way.
