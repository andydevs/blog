I love metaprogramming. Write less code, and be way more expressive. In a sense, it allows you to hack the language and define your own syntax.
I'm going over metaprogramming in Python, Ruby, and Javascript.

## Python

Recap first class closure functions, function factories, and decorators
Using Descriptors
Using class factories
Using metaclasses

## Ruby

Ruby is inherently, unapologetically object-oriented. Scope is determined by what object "self" is. In the main scope, "self" is an instance of Object.
Using define_method, instance_variable_set, const_set, class_variable_set, etc.
Using instance_eval, module_eval, class_eval, etc.
Using responds_to? and method_missing

## Javascript

Prototypical inheritence.
Updating object prototypes.
Hacking the prototype chain.

## Conclusion
