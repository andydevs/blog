    My first full tensorflow application. This trains a model to predict
    wether or not a mushroom was poisonous given some properties of the
    mushroom. The model was trained on a kaggle dataset of mushroom data.

- name: Memes R' Us
  description: >
    This is not an actual retail site. First off, memes are free. Anyone who is 
    telling you otherwise is ripping you off. Second, the site isn't really fully
    functional, let alone clean. I made it in the better half of a week
    so I was rushing. This was mainly a project to more familiarize myself 
    with the Stripe payment system, especially in the context of an ecommerce
    site. Again, you want memes, go to reddit... or even instagram. Never buy
    them. It is illegal to sell memes... I think. Also if the site is still
    running (which it may not be because I'm paying for S3), I did all the
    styling by hand... because I'm mad
