UPDATE 9/16/2017: The IDE idea has been scrapped for now. Gonna focus on other projects.

I've been working on (or putting off, to be honest), building a lightweight, open, and customizable IDE in Ruby. I've been currently making components of this IDE as RubyGems which handle templating ([General](https:/andydevs.github.io/general)) and file management ([Roject](https://andydevs.github.io/roject)).

But now I've been thinking, what if I made the IDE in Python?

Python is a _very_ versatile language. I am surprised how many different things Python is used for. It's used in animation, robotics, web design, game design, data science, Sublime Text 3 plugins, and so many more. In fact, Python is the first programming language that almost anyone who isn't explicitly a computer scientist or software engineer learns. Heck, it's the first programming language that most programmers learned (for me, Python was the second language I learned, the first being JavaScript).

For one, when compared to other languages like Ruby, C, and Java, Python is a simpler and more dynamic language. It's better than Ruby, since it's multi-paradigm, both functional and Object-Oriented, while Ruby is explicity Object-Oriented. It's better than C since it's a scripting language, yet it can be compiled into virtual byte code that can be run on a virtual machine. It's better than Java for both being multi-paradigm and a scripting language.

More importantly, though, Python has a huge community of contributers and module builders who have extended the language with so many different modules. It's the closest thing to a all-encompasing super-language that's used for pretty much everything.

So if I make the IDE in Python, I can take advantage of the larger community of Python contributers and modules, while also programming in simpler and more versatile language, and even make Sublime Text modules which interact with this system. I can already think of one or two food-related titles for this IDE.

I'll continue to make updates to [General](https:/andydevs.github.io/general) and [Roject](https://andydevs.github.io/roject), as I know that there are people using those modules and would love that they keep getting updated, but I'm be considering moving the project and these modules to Python. Be on the lookout for some updates on that.
