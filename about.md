![Me]({{ site.url }}/resources/images/profilepic.jpg){:.graphic-right}

I am a self-taught freelance programmer, a problem-solver, an avid learner, and an overall curious individual. I'm currently pursuing a degree in  Computer Engineering, while I also work on programming projects on the side. I am also a cinemaphile, and like to talk boatloads about all things cinema.

This website is where I update the general public on what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and, in general, what I'm thinking about (with regards to programming). If you want to stay tuned you can check this website, or follow my [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml) or my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
