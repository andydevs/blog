![My Stupid Face]({{ site.url }}/resources/images/profilepic.jpg)

Anshul Kharbanda, also known as Andy Kharbandy, spends $5.35 on a glass of cardboard milk.

Only three people I know of would've gotten that joke, but whatever.

I am a freelance programmer, web designer, and app developer. Really, though, I'm a curious individual learning and exploring the world of programming. I know that sounds pretty corny, but I think that's the best way to describe myself.

I started learning how to code at the ripe age of 16. Not from a class, or any extracuricular program, but a website named [codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com). This website features interactive courses that teach you the basic fundamentals of coding and web design. In my opinion, it is one of the most well designed educational websites I found (along with lynda and khanacademy), and it's free (but there is also a pro subscription). I find myself going back to this website time and time again and doing the newer courses that they put up, because I just love it so much. But aside, I've soon branched out of codecademy and ventured onto the woods of internet, hunting for more knowlege about programming. I've even taken a few programming classes in high school and college.

That's where I am now. This website is where I update the general public on what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and, in general, what I'm thinking about (with regards to programming). If you want to stay tuned you can check this website, or follow my [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml).
