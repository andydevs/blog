![Me]({{ site.url }}/resources/images/profilepic.jpg){:.graphic-right}

I am a freelance programmer, a problem-solver, an avid learner, and an overall curious individual. I started learning how to code at the ripe age of 16. Not from a class, or any extracuricular program, but a website named [codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com). 

Yes, I learned from a website. I see a stigma attached to that, but do I believe in online learning and all the things it can teach.

But aside, I've soon branched out of codecademy and started learning on my own. I've even taken a few programming classes in high school and college. Primarily, though, I'm self taught.

That's where I am now. This website is where I update the general public on what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and, in general, what I'm thinking about (with regards to programming). If you want to stay tuned you can check this website, or follow my [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml) or my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
