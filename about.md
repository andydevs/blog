![Me]({{ site.url }}/resources/images/profilepic.jpg){:.graphic-right}

I am a self-taught freelance programmer with proficiency in Python and Javascript. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, while I also work on programming projects on the side. I am also a cinemaphile, and like to talk boatloads about all things cinema.

This website is where I update (on occasion) the general public on what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and, in general, what I'm thinking about (with regards to programming). If you wish to stay tuned you can check this website, or follow my [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml) (if you still use those). You can also check my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) for more of my updates and general antics.
